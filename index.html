              Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the

                CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
                physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s
                appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
                equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He
                was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
                particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
                he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
                with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
                evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell
                faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
                instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes
                like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like
                a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out
                all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not
                missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the
                ocean. “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top
                of the page and drew a double box around it. <br />
                On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers
                reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and
                that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
                right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first
                sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team
                of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian
                Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of
                space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a
                universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a
                trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They
                are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof,
                Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
