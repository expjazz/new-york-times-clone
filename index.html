              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics. <br />
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead
              he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin
              with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution
              could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted
              a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant. <br />
              If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
              heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
              warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
              wrinkles and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but
              would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. <br />
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the
              page and drew a double box around it. <br />
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

              inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth
              was correct.

              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark
              in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
              pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
              open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
              speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we
              see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds
              of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
              larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over. Editors’ Picks You Are Your Safest Sex

              ‘As Big as It Gets’<br />
              In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
              operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
              accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
              Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
              gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
              general relativity, should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of
              Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not
              part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He
              continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
              sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” The ripples
              manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of
              microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture
              of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
              surface of the sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an
              experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
              Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific
              briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a
              set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

              Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only
              one in 10 million. Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled
              over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in
              his lifetime. <br />
              “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
              been lucky.” The results are the closely guarded distillation of
              three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email
              for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his
              work to a select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a
              professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
              Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last
              week. “It was a very special moment, and one we took very
              seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as
              carefully as he tended his radio telescopes. Andrei Linde of
              Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular
              variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was
              about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin
              Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
              <a href="#"> knocked on his door </a>with a bottle of Champagne to
              tell him the news.

              Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had
              ordered anything. “And then I told him that in the beginning we
              thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
              ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order
              it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an email. Calling from
              Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
              hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of
              spoiling a vacation,” he said. By last weekend, as social media
              was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news
              spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and
              caution. <br />
              Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think
              that if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest
              discoveries in the history of science.” John E. Carlstrom of the
              University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
              project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply
              impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
              convincing,” he said. Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a
              competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
              universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep
              result would eliminate his model, but he expressed reservations
              about inflation. Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others
              also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
              results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of
              the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck
              satellite and other assumptions about the universe. “So we will
              need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
              Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
              will report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other
              teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops
              and space. Spirals in the Sky Gravity waves are the latest and
              deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
              discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell
              Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize. Dr. Kovac has spent
              his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of
              four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly
              sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry
              air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement
              Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California

              “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be
              on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he
              said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he
              said.

                The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the
                faint spiraling gravity patterns — the signature of a universe
                being wrenched violently apart at its birth.Credit...Steffen

              In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave
              radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight
              preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another. This
              was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational
              waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction
              and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
              direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a
              result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little
              arrows going in spirals. Detecting those spirals required
              measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of
              the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a
              giant superconducting thermometer. “We had no expectations what we
              would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The strength of the signal surprised
              the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a
              Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and
              worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough. A
              Special Time The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that
              physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house
              35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution
              of the universe. <br />
              Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:
              gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But
              they have long suspected that those are simply different
              manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe
              in its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe cooled,
              according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some
              old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each
              other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another
              splitting away. That was where Dr. Guth came in. Under some
              circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature
              falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it
              will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat. Similarly, the
              universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long.
              In that case, space itself would become imbued with a mysterious
              latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent
              energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe would
              blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive
              force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
              What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at
              least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of
              primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a
              cosmic eye-blink. Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside,
              relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal
              cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable
              universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across.
              “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr.
              Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free
              lunch.”
              <br />
              Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting
              from Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once
              started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
              comfortable homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue
              blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known
              as the multiverse. So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright
              and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any deeper into
              the past. We might never know what happened before inflation, at
              the very beginning, because inflation erases everything that came
              before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment
              are swept away, forever out of our view. “If you trace your cosmic
              roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who
              was not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
