              CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
              physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
              at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
              venturing far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to
              understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
              should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered
              what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
              hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
              infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
              repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the
              speed of light for a prodigiously violent instant. If true, the
              rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look
              uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
              enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
              irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
              diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
              REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
              double box around it. <br />
              On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
              that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
              hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
              cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
              astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center
              for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time —
              so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
              wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
              trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac
              and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.

              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
              many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be
              proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark
              in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy
              pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
              open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
              speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we
              see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds
              of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a
              larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable.
              Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
              of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
              pasta water boiling over. Editors’ Picks You Are Your Safest Sex

            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
            operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
            accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself.
            Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of
            gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of
            Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part
            of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued,
            “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a
            telegram encoded in gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested
            themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
            that permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it
            was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr.
            Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
            Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
            reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
            Astrophysical Journal.

              THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position
              in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about
              92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we
              look, the universe has an even temperature.

            <div class="number2">
              NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have
              traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the
              other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of
              hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

              DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to

              amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it
              has cooled.

              COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other
              direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
              temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in
              every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

              STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry

              the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all
              at the same time, that might explain their even temperature.

              INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than
              a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
              faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
              expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale
              structures of the universe.

              FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these
              ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic
              background radiation, which is energy left over from the early
              universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

              EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
              expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as
              it expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of
              the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
